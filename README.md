# Description <br/>

The goal of `soiltestcorr` is to assist users on reproducible analysis
of relationships between crop relative yield (ry) and soil test values
(stv) following different approaches. <br/>

The current available methods of correlation analysis in `soiltestcorr`
are: <br/>

## 1. Modified Arcsine-Log Calibration Curve <br/>

The first method available is the Modified Arcsine-log Calibration Curve
(`mod_alcc()`) originally described by Dyson and Conyers (2013) and
modified by Correndo et al. (2017). This function produces the
estimation of critical soil test values (CSTV) for a target relative
yield (ry) with confidence intervals at adjustable confidence levels.
<br/>

<b> mod_alcc() </b> <br/>

Instructions <br/>

1.  Load your data frame with soil test value (stv) and relative yield
    (ry) data. <br/>

2.  Specify the following arguments into the function -mod_alcc()-:
    <br/>

(a). `data` (optional), <br/>

(b). `stv` (soil test value) and `ry` (relative yield) columns or
vectors, <br/>

(c). `target` of relative yield (e.g. 90%), <br/>

(d). desired `confidence` level (e.g. 0.95 for 1 - alpha(0.05)). Used
for the estimation of critical soil test value (CSTV) lower and upper
limits. <br/>

(e). `plot` TRUE (produces a ggplot as main output) or FALSE -default-
(no plot, only results as list or tibble), <br/>

(f). `tidy` TRUE -default- (produces a tibble with results) or FALSE
(store results as list), <br/>

3.  Run and check results. <br/>

4.  Check residuals plot (see Section [3.3 SMA
    Residuals](https://adriancorrendo.github.io/soiltestcorr/articles/mod_alcc_tutorial.html#sma-residuals)),
    and warnings related to potential leverage points. <br/>

5.  Adjust curve plots as desired. <br/>

Example of mod_alcc() output

    #> Warning: One or more original RY values exceeded 100%. All RY values greater 
    #>           than 100% have been capped to 100%.
    #> Warning: 2 STV points exceeded the CSTV for 100% of RY.
    #>   Risk of leverage. You may consider a sensitivity analysis by removing extreme points, 
    #>   re-run the mod_alcc(), and check results.
    #> Warning: 2 STV points exceeded two-times (2x) 
    #>   the CSTV for 90% of RY. Risk of leverage. You may consider a sensitivity analysis by 
    #>   removing extreme points, re-run the mod_alcc(), and check results.

## 2. Cate & Nelson Quadrants Analysis (1965) <br/>

`soiltestcorr` also allows users to implement the quadrants analysis
approach, also known as the Cate-Nelson analysis. There are two versions
of the Cate-Nelson technique: <br/>

Thus, the second alternative is based on Cate and Nelson (1965)
(`cate_nelson_1965()`). The first step of this method is to apply an
arbitrarily fixed value of ry as a target (y-axis) that divides the data
into two categories (below & equal or above ry target). In a second
stage, it estimates the CSTV (x-axis) as the minimum stv that divides
the data into four quadrants (target ry level combined with STV lower or
greater than the CSTV) maximizing the number of points under
well-classified quadrants (II, stv \>= CSTV & ry \>= ry target; and IV,
stv \< CSTV & ry \< RY target). This is also known as the “graphical”
version of the Cate-Nelson approach. <br/>

<b> cate_nelson_1965() </b> <br/>

Instructions <br/>

1.  Load your data frame with soil test value (stv) and relative yield
    (ry) data. <br/>

2.  Specify the following arguments into the function
    -cate_nelson_1965()-: <br/>

(a). `data` (optional), <br/>

(b). `stv` (soil test value) and `ry` (relative yield) columns or
vectors, <br/>

(c). `plot` TRUE (produces a ggplot as main output) or FALSE (no plot,
only results as list or tibble), <br/>

(d). `tidy` TRUE-default- (produces a tibble with results) or FALSE (store
results as list), <br/>

3.  Run and check results. <br/>

4.  Adjust plot as desired. <br/>

## 3. Cate & Nelson Quadrants Analysis (1971) <br/>

The third alternative is based on Cate and Nelson (1971)
(`cate_nelson_1971()`). The first step of this alternative version is to
estimate the CSTV (x-axis) as the minimum stv that minimizes the
residual sum of squares when dividing data points in two classes (lower
or greater than the CSTV) without using an arbitrary ry. This refined
version does not constrains the model performance (measured with the
coefficient of determination -R2-) but the user has no control on the RY
level for the CSTV. This is also known as the “statistical” version of
the Cate-Nelson approach. <br/>

<b> cate_nelson_1971() </b> <br/>

Instructions <br/>

1.  Load your data frame with soil test value (stv) and relative yield
    (ry) data. <br/>

2.  Specify the following arguments into the function
    -cate_nelson_1971()-: <br/>

(a). `data` (optional), <br/>

(b). `stv` (soil test value) and `ry` (relative yield) columns or
vectors, <br/>

(c). `plot` TRUE-default- (produces a ggplot as main output) or FALSE (no plot,
only results as list or tibble), <br/>

(d). `tidy` TRUE (produces a tibble with results) or FALSE (store
results as list), <br/>

3.  Run and check results. <br/>

4.  Adjust plot as desired. <br/>

## 4. Linear-plateau Regression </b> <br/>

The next method available is the linear-plateau model
(`linear_plateau()`). This function fits the classical regression
response model that follows two phases: i) a first linear phase
described as `y = a + b*x`, and ii) a second plateau-phase (Anderson and
Nelson, 1975) were the `ry` response to increasing `stv` becomes NULL
(flat), described as `plateau = y = a + b*Xc`, where `y` represents the
fitted crop relative yield, `x` the soil test value, `a` the intercept
(ry when stv = 0) , `b` the slope (as the change in ry per unit of soil
nutrient supply or nutrient added), and `X_c` the join-point when the
plateau-phase starts (i.e. the CSTV). The `linear_plateau()` function
works automatically with self starting initial values to facilitate the
model’s convergence. <br/>

<b> linear_plateau() </b> <br/>

Instructions <br/>

1.  Load your data frame or vectors with soil test value (stv) and
    relative yield (ry) data. <br/>

2.  Specify the following arguments into the function
    -linear_plateau()-: <br/>

(a). `data` (optional), <br/>

(b). `stv` (soil test value) and `ry` (relative yield) columns or
vectors, <br/>

(c). `target` (optional) if want to know stv level needed for a
different \`ry\`\` than the plateau.

(d). `plot` TRUE (produces a ggplot as main output) or FALSE (no plot,
only results as tibble), <br/>

(e). `resid` TRUE (produces plots with residuals analysis) or FALSE (no
plot), <br/>

(f). `tidy` TRUE-default- (produces a tibble with results) or FALSE (store
results as list), <br/>

3.  Run and check results. <br/>

4.  Check residuals plot, and warnings related to potential limitations
    of this model. <br/>

5.  Adjust curve plots as desired. <br/>

## 5. Quadratic-plateau Regression </b> <br/>

The following correlation method available is the quadratic-plateau
model (`quadratic_plateau()`). This function fits the classical
regression response model that follows two phases: i) a first
curvilinear phase described as `y = a + b*x + c*x^2`, and ii) a second
plateau-phase (Bullock and Bullock, 1994) were the `ry` response to
increasing `stv` becomes NULL (flat), described as
`plateau = y = a + b*Xc + c*Xc`, where `y` represents the fitted crop
relative yield, `x` the soil test value, `a` the intercept (ry when stv
= 0) , `b` the linear slope (as the change in ry per unit of soil
nutrient supply or nutrient added), `c` the quadratic coefficient
(giving the curve shape), and `X_c` the join-point when the
plateau-phase starts (i.e. the CSTV). The `quadratic_plateau()` function
works automatically with self starting initial values to facilitate the
model convergence. <br/>

<b> quadratic_plateau() </b> <br/>

Instructions <br/>

1.  Load your data frame with soil test value (stv) and relative yield
    (ry) data. <br/>

2.  Specify the following arguments into the function
    -quadratic_plateau()-: <br/>

(a). `data` (optional), <br/>

(b). `stv` (soil test value) and `ry` (relative yield) columns or
vectors, <br/>

(c). `target` (optional) if want to know stv level needed for a
different \`ry\`\` than the plateau.

(d). `plot` TRUE (produces a ggplot as main output) or FALSE (no plot,
only results as tibble), <br/>

(e). `resid` TRUE (produces plots with residuals analysis) or FALSE (no
plot), <br/>

(f). `tidy` TRUE-default- (produces a tibble with results) or FALSE (store
results as list), <br/>

## 6. Mitscherlich Regression </b> <br/>

This function fits an exponential regression response model (Melsted and
Peck, 1977) that follows a curve shape described as
`y = a * (1-exp(-c(x + b))`, where `a = asymptote`, `b = xintercept`,
`c = rate or curvature parameter`. The `mitscherlich()` function works
automatically with self starting initial values to facilitate the
model’s convergence. This approach is extensively used in agriculture to
describe crops response to input since the biological meaning of its
curved response. With 3 alternatives to fit the model, this function
brings the advantage of controlling the parameters quantity: i) type = 1
(DEFAULT), corresponding to the model without any restrictions to the
parameters (`y = a * (1-exp(-c(x + b))`); ii) type = 2 (“asymptote
100”), corresponding to the model with only 2 parameters by setting the
asymptote = 100 (`y = 100 * (1-exp(-c(x + b))`), and iii) type = 3
(“asymptote 100 from 0”), corresponding to the model with only 1
parameter by constraining the asymptote = 100 and xintercept = 0
(`y = 100 * (1-exp(-c(x))`). <br/>

Instructions <br/>

1.  Load your data frame with soil test value (stv) and relative yield
    (ry) data. <br/>

2.  Specify the following arguments into the function -mitscherlich()-:
    <br/>

(a). `data` (optional), <br/>

(b). `stv` (soil test value) and `ry` (relative yield) columns or
vectors, <br/>

(c). `target` (optional) if want to know stv level needed for a specific
`ry`.

(d). `plot` TRUE (produces a ggplot as main output) or FALSE (no plot,
only results as tibble), <br/>

(e). `resid` TRUE (produces plots with residuals analysis) or FALSE (no
plot), <br/>

(f). `tidy` TRUE-default- (produces a tibble with results) or FALSE (store
results as list), <br/>

3.  Run and check results. <br/>

4.  Check residuals plot, and warnings related to potential limitations
    of this model. <br/>

5.  Adjust curve plots as desired. <br/>
